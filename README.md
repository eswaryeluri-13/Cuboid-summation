# Cuboid-summation-
 This project "CUBOID SUMMATION"  implements a 3D Fenwick Tree to efficiently calculate the sum of a given rectangular region within a 3D space. 
 It provides an update function to add values to individual elements and a getRect function that can be used to calculate the sum of a given rectangle. 
 By using the Fenwick Tree, this code is able to perform efficient sum calculations on large 3D spaces.
